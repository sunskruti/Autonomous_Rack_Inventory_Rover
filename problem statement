Rack Inventory Rover 

1. Core System Design (80 Points) 
Choose ONE of the following two tracks (A or B). Both tracks are weighted equally and 
require a comprehensive, detailed solution. 
TRACK A: Systems & Methodology (80 Points) 
Provide a detailed technical paper and methodology addressing the following: 
● QR Code Scanning & Data Management (35 Points): 
○ Propose a robust methodology for scanning 5x5 cm QR codes from a moving 
platform, ensuring a >90% detection rate. 
○ Detail the image processing pipeline (e.g., blur detection, perspective 
correction, lighting adjustment). 
○ Specify the data structure for storing scanned information, which must include 
a timestamp, rack/shelf identifier, the decoded QR data, and a low-resolution 
image snippet for verification. 
● Rack Detection & Precision Alignment (25 Points): 
○ Propose a sensor-fusion methodology (e.g., using LiDAR, depth cameras, 
and/or ultrasonic sensors) to detect and align the rover parallel to warehouse 
racks. 
○ Your method must be robust to variable ambient lighting, specular reflections 
from racking, and low-light areas. 
○ Explain how your system will achieve the required horizontal positioning 
accuracy of ±10 cm relative to the rack face before initiating a vertical scan. 
● X-Y Drive & Motion Control (20 Points): 
○ Analyze and justify the selection of a specific drive mechanism (e.g., 
differential, omni-directional, Ackerman) for the chassis. 
○ Your analysis must consider trade-offs between maneuverability in narrow 
aisles, cost, and control complexity to achieve smooth motion and meet the 
<3-second path planning time. --- OR --- 
TRACK B: Detailed Design & Architecture (80 Points) 
Provide a detailed design and architecture package for the rover, including: 
● Mechanical Design (CAD & Drawings) (35 Points): 
○ Provide (3D CAD models, 2D assembly) / manual diagrams for: 
1. The X-Y chassis, respecting the dimensional constraints (<600mm x 
450mm, <25kg). 
2. The Z-motion vertical scanning mechanism, capable of smoothly 
scanning a full 1.8m rack height and meeting the ±2 cm vertical 
positioning accuracy. 
○ Justify material choices and mechanical design decisions. 
○ Your choice of design and components must justify how the specified 
accuracies (±10 cm horizontal, ±2 cm vertical) will be achieved. 
● Camera & Sensor Positioning (25 Points): 
○ Justify the selection and precise positioning of the primary scanning camera 
(min. 1920x1080 resolution), including lensing, angle, and lighting strategy. 
○ Your justification must clearly demonstrate how this configuration will achieve 
the >90% detection rate for 5x5 cm QR codes under warehouse conditions. 
○ Detail the placement of all navigation and safety sensors (LiDAR, depth 
cameras, E-stop buttons). 
● Robot & Electrical Architecture (20 Points): 
○ Present a complete robot architecture diagram showing all major components 
and data flow. 
○ Provide a detailed List of Materials for key electronic COTS components, 
including the primary controller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano), motor 
drivers, sensors, and power system. 
2. Simulation & Autonomous Navigation (20 Points) 
● Gazebo Warehouse Environment (5 points): 
○ Generate a standard warehouse environment in the Gazebo simulator, 
including multiple aisles, standardized racks (which may differ from the exact 
specifications in the original PS), and various obstacles. 
● SLAM & Navigation (15 Points): 
○ In the simulated environment, implement, demonstrate, or provide a detailed 
methodology for a complete SLAM pipeline to generate an accurate map of 
the warehouse. 
○ Using the generated map, demonstrate autonomous navigation from a 
starting point to a designated rack. The rover must demonstrate the ability to 
navigate to the rack's vicinity; precise alignment for this task is optional. 
○ Hint: The solution should use a standard navigation stack (e.g., ROS 2 Nav2) 
and demonstrate robust obstacle avoidance. 
3. Bonus: Competitive Analysis (Bonus Points) 
● Conduct a brief market analysis of existing commercial solutions for autonomous 
warehouse inventory management (excluding Eternal Robotics and its subsidiaries). 
● Provide a concise summary of their technological approach (e.g., sensor suite, 
navigation method) and how their solution compares to or aligns with the one 
proposed in this problem statement.
